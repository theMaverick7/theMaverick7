# Hi, I'm Faiq 👋

**Aspiring Backend Systems Engineer | Intelligent Systems Architect**

Final-year student exploring the intersection of backend engineering and intelligent systems.

---

### 🛠️ Core Stack
**Backend Core** | Node.js, Python, Express, Django |
**Intelligent Systems** | OpenAI API, LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) |
**Data & Storage** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Vector Databases
**DevOps & Infrastructure** | Docker, Git, RESTful API Design, Postman |

### 🏗️ My Focus Areas
- 🤖 **Agentic Backend Systems:** Designing servers that don't just store data, but "think" and act using LLMs.
- ⚡ **Scalable Architectures:** Implementing efficient data flow and caching to handle high-concurrency environments.
- 🔍 **Vector Search & RAG:** Building knowledge-aware systems that provide contextually relevant AI responses.
- 🛠️ **System Design:** Moving beyond code to think about how components interact for reliability and speed.
